Josh — Engineering Leadership | Python • TestStand • C • C#

Driving high‑impact, production‑grade solutions across test automation and systems engineering. I build resilient pipelines, accelerate verification, and de‑risk deployments.



Executive Summary

Seasoned engineer with an end‑to‑end mindset: requirements → architecture → implementation → validation → continuous delivery. I specialize in Python frameworks, NI TestStand orchestration, and low‑level C/C# integrations to deliver scalable test solutions and reliable software.

Business Outcomes: faster time‑to‑test, higher coverage, fewer regressions, cleaner releases.

Technical Edge: robust tooling, strong observability, deterministic builds, and repeatable results.

Core Competencies

Python: tooling, CLIs, services, data handling, test frameworks (pytest, unittest), packaging (poetry/pip), type safety (mypy/pyright), linters (ruff/flake8), docs (Sphinx/Markdown).

NI TestStand: sequence architecture, step customizations, process models, hardware‑in‑loop, LabVIEW/C# adapters, result processing, report/DB logging, parallel execution, operator UI.

C & C#: device integration, performance‑critical modules, P/Invoke and interop, .NET 6/7, WPF/WinForms utilities, REST/GRPC clients, instrumentation drivers.

Quality Engineering: CI/CD (GitHub Actions), artifact/versioning, test analytics, coverage, reproducible environments (Docker/venv), code reviews, static/dynamic analysis.

Systems & Tooling: Windows & Linux, Git, Make/CMake, PowerShell/Bash, networking fundamentals, monitoring/telemetry.

Signature Deliverables

Automated Test Platforms: Modular, maintainable TestStand sequences with Python/C# plug‑ins, standardized reporting, database sinks, and headless runners.

Device & Protocol Toolkits: C/C# libraries and Python bindings for instrument control and high‑throughput data capture.

Verification Pipelines: Multi‑stage CI with gated merges, matrix testing, signed artifacts, and release notes on autopilot.

Selected Projects

Replace placeholders with your repos; keep it outcome‑centric.

TestStand Enterprise Template — Opinionated starter for parallel test, custom process models, and unified result logging.Impact: cut onboarding time by >50%, standardized reporting across products.

Python Instrument SDK — Cross‑platform drivers + async acquisition with clean APIs and examples.Impact: enabled rapid feature development, reduced bug surface in integration.

C# Operator Console — WPF app for station control, calibration, and diagnostics with role‑based access & telemetry.Impact: decreased MTTR and improved traceability in production lines.
