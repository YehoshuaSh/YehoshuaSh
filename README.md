## Executive Summary
Seasoned engineer with an end‑to‑end mindset: requirements → architecture → implementation → validation → continuous delivery. I specialize in Python frameworks, NI TestStand orchestration, and low‑level C/C# integrations to deliver scalable test solutions and reliable software.

- **Business Outcomes:** faster time‑to‑test, higher coverage, fewer regressions, cleaner releases.
- **Technical Edge:** robust tooling, strong observability, deterministic builds, and repeatable results.

---

## Core Competencies
- **Python:** tooling, CLIs, services, data handling, test frameworks (pytest, unittest), packaging (poetry/pip), type safety (mypy/pyright), linters (ruff/flake8), docs (Sphinx/Markdown).
- **NI TestStand:** sequence architecture, step customizations, process models, hardware‑in‑loop, LabVIEW/C# adapters, result processing, report/DB logging, parallel execution, operator UI.
- **C & C#:** device integration, performance‑critical modules, P/Invoke and interop, .NET 6/7, WPF/WinForms utilities, REST/GRPC clients, instrumentation drivers.
- **Quality Engineering:** CI/CD (GitHub Actions), artifact/versioning, test analytics, coverage, reproducible environments (Docker/venv), code reviews, static/dynamic analysis.
- **Systems & Tooling:** Windows & Linux, Git, Make/CMake, PowerShell/Bash, networking fundamentals, monitoring/telemetry.

---

## Signature Deliverables
- **Automated Test Platforms:** Modular, maintainable TestStand sequences with Python/C# plug‑ins, standardized reporting, database sinks, and headless runners.
- **Device & Protocol Toolkits:** C/C# libraries and Python bindings for instrument control and high‑throughput data capture.
- **Verification Pipelines:** Multi‑stage CI with gated merges, matrix testing, signed artifacts, and release notes on autopilot.

## Selected Projects
> Replace placeholders with your repos; keep it outcome‑centric.

- **TestStand Enterprise Template** — Opinionated starter for parallel test, custom process models, and unified result logging.  
  _Impact:_ cut onboarding time by **>50%**, standardized reporting across products.

- **Python Instrument SDK** — Cross‑platform drivers + async acquisition with clean APIs and examples.  
  _Impact:_ enabled rapid feature development, reduced bug surface in integration.

- **C# Operator Console** — WPF app for station control, calibration, and diagnostics with role‑based access & telemetry.  
  _Impact:_ decreased MTTR and improved traceability in production lines.
